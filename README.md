piccolo max9814
=======

The main Adafruit [Piccolo][piccolo] project uses an Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX4466 in their setup, when using a [MAX9814][microphoneAmp] with the same code the LED matrix isn't looking that great. This is my take on the Piccolo project using a MAX9814 Microphone Amplifier.
